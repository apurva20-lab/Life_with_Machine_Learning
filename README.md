# Problem Statement 
   Dataset contains information about flight booking options.There are 300261 datapoints and 11 features in the cleaned dataset. Our goals is to (1) answer the business questions proposed and (2) to build a machine learning model to predict flight prices.
# Questions to Answer - 
1. Does price vary with Airlines?
2. How is the price affected when tickets are bought in just 1 or 2 days before departure?
3. Does ticket price change based on the departure time and arrival time?
4. How the price changes with change in Source and Destination?
5. How does the ticket price vary between Economy and Business class?
# Observations after Analysis- 
-- In the Economy Class: The cheapest airline is Air Asia and The most expensive airline is Vistara
-- In the Business Class: The cheapest airline is Air India and The most expensive airline is Vistara
-- In general: The most expensive airline is Vistara and The cheapest airline is Air Asia
# The median price when tickets are bought in just 1 day before departure:  14150.0
# The median price when tickets are bought in just 2 days before departure:  13212.0
# The cheapest time to travel is Late at Night.
# Prediction model applied is Randon Forest Classifier
# The Mean Absolut Error(MAE) is :  1076.6305771054467
